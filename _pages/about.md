About me
======

Hiya, I'm a doctoral student at the Nanjing University, China, currently majoring in Optics and Photonics in Dielectric Superlattice Lab. guided by Prof. Zhu Shining, and advised by Prof. Shuming Wang.

My research interests mainly focus on the field of Nanophotonics, specifically the physical mechanism of metasurface, multifunctional meta-device design and topological photonics in non-Hermite system. In parallel, I also study on optical manipulation based on metasurface with Prof. Shaohui Yan (XIOPM) and Dr. Xiaohao Xu (Jinan Univ. Guangzhou), and expected to discover something new in classic and quantum physics.

Also, I've previously participated in different research areas with Prof. Houjun LÃ¼ (Guangxi Univ.) on High Energy Astrophysics and with Prof. Ziqian Chen (Guangxi. Univ.) on optical gauge as well as precise alignment of interferometers with Prof. Xuemin Zhang (Wuhan Univ.).

<!-- __Update: I will be joining Stanford University as a Ph.D. student in Fall 2021!__ -->

Research area
======

<img width="175" align="left" src="../images/tianyue.png"/>
Optical tweezers (OT) and optical spanner (OS) are powerful tools of optical manipulation, which are responsible for particle trapping and rotation, respectively. Conventionally, the OT and OS are built using bulky three-dimensional devices, such as microscope objectives and spatial light modulators. Recently, metasurfaces are proposed for setting up them on a microscale platform, which greatly miniaturizing the systems. However, the realization of both OT and OS with one identical metasurface is posing a challenge. Here, we offer a metasurface-based solution to integrating the OT and OS.
+ Using the prevailing approach based on the geometric and dynamic phases, we show that it is possible to construct an output field, 
which promises a high-numerical-aperture focal spot, accompanied with a coaxial vortex. Optical trapping and rotation are numerically demonstrated by estimating the mechanical effects on a particle probe. Moreover, we demonstrate an on-demand control of the OT-to-OS distance and the topological charge possessed by the OS. By revealing the OT-OS metasurfaces, our results may empower advanced applications in on-chip particle manipulation.

</div>
<div style="font-size:10pt"> In layer-based 3D fabrication, supporting structures are fabricated
to support overhanging regions yet discarded later. Reducing supports
saves both time and material cost. In this project, we propose 
a real-time skinning-based method to slim down the
supporting structure while maintaining a detailed-preserved and semantically meaningful geometry.
We achieve this by optimizing a set of performance objectives and searching globally in
the subspace spanned by the joint handles. Artifacts e.g. self-intersection can be effectively avoided.
Our method is implemented via OpenGL shaders and has potential to be
employed as a structural prototyping tool that facilitates model design and fabrication. </div>
