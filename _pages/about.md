About me
======
Hiya, I'm a doctoral student at the Nanjing University, China, currently majoring in Optics and Photonics in [Dielectric Superlattice Lab.](http://slab.nju.edu.cn/)  guided by  [Prof. Zhu Shining](http://slab.nju.edu.cn/teamdetail.aspx?id=16), and advised by  >[Prof. Shuming Wang](https://physics.nju.edu.cn/sz/gdkxx/20191105/i45277.html)


<p align = "justify">My research interests mainly focus on the field of Nanophotonics, specifically the physical mechanism of metasurface, multifunctional meta-device design, Metalenses design for imaging and topological photonics in non-Hermite system. In parallel, I also study on optical manipulation based on metasurface with Prof. Shaohui Yan (XIOPM) and Dr. Xiaohao Xu (Jinan Univ. Guangzhou), and expected to discover something new in classic and quantum physics..</p>

<p align = "justify">Also, I've previously participated in different research areas with Prof. Houjun LÃ¼ (Guangxi Univ.) on High Energy Astrophysics and with Prof. Ziqian Chen (Guangxi. Univ.) on optical gauge as well as precise alignment of interferometers with Prof. Xuemin Zhang (Wuhan Univ.).</p>

<p align = "justify">I'm honored to be selected as an 'Outstanding Speaker' in 2nd National Academic Forum on Photonics Technology and Awarded Second Prize of Presentation Contest in The 1st 'Light & Future' National Graduate Academic Forum.</p>

<!-- __Update: I will be joining Stanford University as a Ph.D. student in Fall 2021!__ -->

Research area
======

<p align = "justify">Optical tweezers (OT) and optical spanner (OS) are powerful tools of optical manipulation, which are responsible for particle trapping and rotation, respectively. Conventionally, the OT and OS are built using bulky three-dimensional devices, such as microscope objectives and spatial light modulators. Recently, metasurfaces are proposed for setting up them on a microscale platform, which greatly miniaturizing the systems. In this topic, we offer a metasurface-based solution to integrating the OT and OS. Using the prevailing approach based on the geometric and dynamic phases, we show that it is possible to construct an output field, which promises a high-numerical-aperture focal spot, accompanied with a coaxial vortex. Optical trapping and rotation are numerically demonstrated by estimating the mechanical effects on a particle probe. Moreover, we demonstrate an on-demand control of the OT-to-OS distance and the topological charge possessed by the OS. By revealing the OT-OS metasurfaces, our results may empower advanced applications in on-chip particle manipulation</p>


<br/>
<p align = "justify">Bessel beam has the properties of propagation invariance and self-healing effect, leading to a variety of interesting phenomena and applications. Recently, as one of planar diffractive elements with miniaturized size, metasurfaces has been widely employed to manipulate light in the subwavelength region including generating Bessel beam. However, such metasurface-generated Bessel beam allows the output light with no tunable functions. Here, with the interplay of the geometric phase and the dynamic phase, we propose a method to generate and provide the conversion from any orthogonal polarizations to independent Bessel beams with single-layer dielectric metasurface. The simulation results indicate that the arbitrary conversion between different Bessel beams is related to the spin-dependent orbit motion caused by the tight focusing effect, leading to the singularity of the spot. This physical mechanism has been well studied and the theoretical model for revealing the dependence of different incident polarization on the conversion dynamics is presented. Our approach paves a way for efficient generation and multifunctional applications, ranging from high-numerical-aperture devices to compact nanophotonic platforms for spin-dependent structured beams</p>

<br/>

<p align = "justify">Metalens possessing the advantages of miniaturized size, are widely employed to manipulate light in the subwavelength region, which breaks the limitation of bulky and complex volume and system compared to the traditional optical elements, and also proved to be of great value in high-resolution imaging. Additionally, the increasingly concerns about how to integrate more functions into a single-layer metalens become a current topic. Here, we propose a method to realize two more optical responses controlled by wavelengths. For proof of-concept, we numerically demonstrate the arbitrary chromatic dispersion based on three metalenses, and design two specific meta-devices named color router and Tri-functional structured light generator allowing the generation of focused beam with or without orbital angular momentum and Bessel beam. Our work expands the range of dispersion-engineering in the field of metalenses, and paves a way for its application like optical micro-manipulation and subwavelength resolution spectral imaging.</p>

</div>
<div style="font-size:10pt"> In layer-based 3D fabrication, supporting structures are fabricated
to support overhanging regions yet discarded later. Reducing supports
saves both time and material cost. In this project, we propose 
a real-time skinning-based method to slim down the
supporting structure while maintaining a detailed-preserved and semantically meaningful geometry.
We achieve this by optimizing a set of performance objectives and searching globally in
the subspace spanned by the joint handles. Artifacts e.g. self-intersection can be effectively avoided.
Our method is implemented via OpenGL shaders and has potential to be
employed as a structural prototyping tool that facilitates model design and fabrication. </div>
